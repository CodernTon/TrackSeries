# TrackSeries
Ongoing project in android studio-set on pause atm(2019-11-1) but will eventually continue on it. 

## Basic Functionality
Add your tv-series and keep track on which episode you are on. In case you for some reason not use netflix or similar streaming services then this is an option to keep track over what series you are currently watching and what episode you are on. 

## Next step
Creating a better frontend, the current application is functional but looks "boring", in the upcoming iterations there is a need for visual enhancements. For a better experience it is also needed to develop for different screen sizes and that is also one of the upcoming parts. For a more stable and quicker development process is being implemented more and more and also of high priority. 

## Short explanation of used techniques
Using Android Studio IDE to develop for android devices. All data is stored locally on the device using databases and specifically SQLite Open to manages the databases.

Pictures coming soon.
